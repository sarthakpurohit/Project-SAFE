### Description

> During emergencies, when stranded in a traffic jam, what's the best possible help one can provide to those in dire need of help? There comes the situation where people can not be extricated from problematic situations as the emergency vehicles can not reach there on time.

> We have created a web portal where users signup and provide their vehicle and contact details. Our Project S.A.F.E is aimed at providing the best and nearest possible help to the stranded emergency vehicles by detecting through cameras installed on roads, the traffic and emergency vehicles. If the image captured  is classified as being in an emergency, the camera captures a picture of the number plate. The text is extracted and sent to the nearest possible help. At the time of the disaster our drones and cameras will capture pics of the vehicles on road and send it to our server.
